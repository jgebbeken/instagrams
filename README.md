# Project 6 - *Instagrams*

**Instagrams** is a photo sharing app using Parse as its backend.

Time spent: **12** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can sign up to create a new account using Parse authentication
- [x] User can log in and log out of his or her account
- [x] The current signed in user is persisted across app restarts
- [x] User can take a photo, add a caption, and post it to "Instagram"
- [x] User can view the last 20 posts submitted to "Instagram"

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Show the username and creation time for each post <- Partial with the username
- [ ] After the user submits a new post, show a progress HUD while the post is being uploaded to Parse.
- [ ] User Profiles:
   - [ ] Allow the logged in user to add a profile photo
   - [ ] Display the profile photo with each post
   - [ ] Tapping on a post's username or profile photo goes to that user's profile page

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Has the ability to reset password via link by email however Parse server does not have functionality of this implemented yet. Code will work if developer has account still with parse.com
- [x] UIAlerts to tell user what they did wrong in the login screen.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Other alternatives of Parse server. 
2. Take a greater look of the documentation to see what else we can do. Perhaps be able to upload more than 10MBs.
